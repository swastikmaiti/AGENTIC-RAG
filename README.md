# AGENTIC-RAG
building a agentic rag with llamaindex to answer user queries with a specialized workflow pipeline.

# Description
In this work we build a Agentic RAG with llamaindex. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is one of the most widespread usecase of LLM.
In RAG there exist a single pipeline for the workflow. Hence all user queries are processed in exactly the same way. However there exist different types 
of user queries which may require different pipenine for processing. In this work we build two piplines to answer user queries with specific need. The pipelines are
- Summarization pipeline
- Question-Answering pipeline
